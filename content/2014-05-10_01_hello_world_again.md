Summary: First (actual) post.

I've decided to start from scratch (once again) on the toaruos.org site. This new blog is built on Pelican. I also intend to actually update it more than once in a blue moon. I've been doing a lot of kernel and UI work on とある recently, and there's a lot to talk about.
