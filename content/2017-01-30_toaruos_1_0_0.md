Summary: ToaruOS 1.0 is ready.

After six years of development, I am very happy to finally announce the 1.0 release of ToaruOS. While I would not consider this "complete" - there is still much work to be done - it is time to refocus my development, and with that comes the time to declare a stable release. ToaruOS 1.0 has been the result of over half a decade of effort, with contributions from a dozen people besides myself.

The full release notes are available [on Github](https://github.com/klange/toaruos/releases/tag/v1.0.0).
