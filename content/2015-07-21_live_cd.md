Summary: First ToaruOS live CD

The first Live CD pre-release of ToaruOS is now available [on our Github releases page](https://github.com/klange/toaruos/releases/tag/v0.11.1-livecd). This Live CD comes with a ramdisk installation of ToaruOS 0.11.1 (kernel tagged `d0518b1`). The filesystem in the CD includes a full base image of the OS, minus test binaries, and boots to a work-in-progress tutorial.

This is a pre-relase, not a final CD. The tutorial is woefully incomplete, and there are many bugs and incomplete features.
